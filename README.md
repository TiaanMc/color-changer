# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Created a basic color app that displays a color and its hex value based on the input of the user.

This app is part of an exercise to use what I have learned from react thus far to start creating projects.
